Hello, this is my senior project!

Below is my Abstract and info on how to run this React App.

# Abstract
Seguridad en Línea is a React Application that aims to give first time, Spanish-speaking internet users the tools and confidence to safely navigate the web on their own. To do this, the web application aims to teach its users about five main topics around everyday internet use. The topics are “Autenticidad del Sitio Web” (Website Authenticity), “Correos Electrónicos de Phishing” (Phishing Emails), “Contraseñas” (Passwords), “Autenticación de Dos Factores” (Two-Factor Authentication) and “Transacciones Seguras en Línea” (Secure Online Transactions). Seguridad en Línea aims to introduce the main concepts about each of these topics to any first time Spanish-speaking user by focusing on the big picture of each module in the comfort of their native language. The Website Authenticity module focuses on the HTTP and HTTPS protocols, domain names and extensions found in a URL. The Phishing Emails module talks about the dangers of phishing emails and how to identify them including the obvious grammatical and spelling errors but also highlighting the sense of urgency that they create. The Passwords module highlights how password managers work and how they can be the solution to generating and storing complex passwords. The Two-Factor Authentication module focuses on how two-factor authentication works and its advantages. The Secure Online Transactions module highlights how a digital wallet can be the solution to safely making transactions on the web. Each module is followed by a friendly knowledge recapitulation to ensure the user has understood the main points of each topic. Seguridad en Línea was developed with a React frontend as the web application’s goal is presenting information in a succinct manner to keep an user engaged but not overwhelmed with information. A demo of the application was also deployed on Heroku.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
